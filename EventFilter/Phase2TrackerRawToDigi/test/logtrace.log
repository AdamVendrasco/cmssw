[Phase2TrackerCablingCfgESSource::make] Building FED cabling map from cfg.
----- Begin Fatal Exception 16-Jul-2024 15:59:59 CEST-----------------------
An exception of category 'ESGetTokenWrongTransition' occurred while
   [0] Processing  stream begin Run run: 1 stream: 0
   [1] Calling method for module Phase2TrackerDigiProducer/'Phase2TrackerDigiProducer'
Exception Message:
The transition ID stored in the ESGetToken does not match the
transition where the token is being used. The associated record
type is: Phase2TrackerCablingRcd
For producers, filters and analyzers this transition ID is
set as a template parameter to the call to the esConsumes
function that creates the token. Event is the default transition.
Other possibilities are BeginRun, EndRun, BeginLuminosityBlock,
or EndLuminosityBlock. You may need multiple tokens if you want to
get the same data in multiple transitions. The transition ID has a
different meaning in ESProducers. For ESProducers, the transition
ID identifies the function that produces the EventSetup data (often
there is one function named produce but there can be multiple
functions with different names). For ESProducers, the ESGetToken
must be used in the function associated with the ESConsumesCollector
returned by the setWhatProduced function.
